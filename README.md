This project is based on replenishment optimization for Covid Vaccination SCM.
For vaccine quantity forecasting  using XGBoost model Predictive model helps in inventory optimization (Minimizing the number of deliveries from Warehouse)gives strong strategy for replenishment optimization.

Tech stack: docker, jupyternotebook, flask

Process:
Model is trained and saved as pkl file under model folder. A simple html file with name main.html is under templates. Flask application is built which takes 
inputs from main.html, and feeds it to model and gives the output as predition.

Deployment:
- Clone the repo 
- Make sure Docker file has EXPOSE port 80 and app.py expose port 5001. In case if these ports are used in your server, please make necessary changes
- Build the docker with command docker build -t my_app . 
- Once Build is successful you cna see the image by running the command docker images 
- Run the docker container with command docker run -p 80:5001 my_app . (please change port numbers accordingly)
- Open the browser and hit http://ip_address should bring up a UI to enter the details and once duly entered all the fields click on "Submit Query" will show the Predition results
- In case of Heroku, make sure the file Procfile exists and login to heroku and then just create app
